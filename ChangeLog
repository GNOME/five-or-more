2001-06-26  Juan Pablo Mendoza <pablo_juan@yahoo.com>

	* glines.c (load_image): Remove more useless code. Use a dialog
	  instead of a printf if we can't find the images. Also fix a ugly
	  check.
	  (set_selection), (set_selection1), (free_str), (fill_menu): This
	  stuff was doing some really nasty things.

	* glines.c, glines.h: Added theme support (via the new settings
	dialog), changed ball.xpm to png: this way, it is easy to decide

        format, backgrounds are xpms).  Added some art files: black.xpm,
        gray.xpm, woody.xpm, marble,xpm, ball.png, classic.png, pulse.png,
        dots.png.

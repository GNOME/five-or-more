	we don't try drawing grid cells that aren't there. Jon McCann
	spotted this.
	
2004-01-09  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

2004-01-07  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

2004-01-06  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* glines.schemas.in: Set balls.svg to be the new default since it
	shows off the resizing routines to the best advantage.

	* glines.c: The resizing work is basically finished. The window
	size isn't remembered yet and there is an expose bug when a window
	is dragged quickly across it. Aside from that it works well.

2004-01-05  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* glines.c: More resizing work and switch over to using the

	balls.svg. Include a bit of logic to make the transition painless.

2004-01-02  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* glines.c (load_image): Rescale graphics to fit. The graphics now
	just have to fit a 4x7 grid. This means that we now support SVG
	properly.

2003-12-28  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* glines.c: Fix attempts to do an expose event before the
	configure event. Remember to connect the configure and expose
	signals to the same widget.

2003-12-17  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* glines.c (fill_menu): Adapt to the new gobject API for

2003-10-21  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Change the way gconf files are
	installed. This should improve things for people building outside
	the source tree. See bug #123192.

2003-10-19  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* glines.c: Replace deprecated functions.
	(main): Remove the explicit realize for the main board.

Wed Aug 27 15:10:24 2003  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	need to use ansi-compatible comments.

2003-07-28  Callum McKenzie <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	background. Unfortunately the balls are still clipped at the top,
	bottom and sides.

2003-07-27  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* glines.c: Compiler warning fixes.

2003-07-10  Callum McKenzie  <callum@physics.otago.ac.nz>

	* glines.c: Fix a race condition where the animation callback may be
	called after the main drawing area is destroyed. Based mostly on
	Jörgen Viksell's <jorgen.viksell@telia.com> patch. Fixes bug 117019.

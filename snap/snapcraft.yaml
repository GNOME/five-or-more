summary: Remove colored balls from the board by forming lines
description: |
 Five or More is the GNOME port of a once-popular computer game. Align five or
 more objects of the same color into a line to cause them to disappear and
 score points. Earn many more points by lining up as many objects as possible
 before clearing them.

 More objects appear after every turn. Play for as long as possible, until the
 board is completely full!

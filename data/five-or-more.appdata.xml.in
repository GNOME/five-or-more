   Five or More is the GNOME port of a once-popular computer game. Align five or
   more objects of the same color into a line to cause them to disappear and
   score points. Earn many more points by lining up as many objects as possible
   before clearing them.
  </_p>
  <_p>
   More objects appear after every turn. Play for as long as possible, until the
   board is completely full!

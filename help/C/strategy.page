  <title>Strategy</title>

  <p>
There is no universal strategy for <app>Five or More</app>, but some strategic elements do exist.  Here are some things to try and keep in mind as you play:</p>
 <list>
   <item><p>Try to set at least three same objects with your every move.</p></item>
   <item><p>The board can quickly become very crowded with objects, so it is best to think ahead. Pay attention to the collection of <gui>Next</gui> objects, because knowing these will influence your moves.</p></item>
    <item><p>Try to line up more than 5 objects.  For example, if you have 6 objects, you can line up 2 and 3 with a space in between, and then connect them by placing the sixth object between them.</p></item>
  </list>

  <title>How to Play</title>

<p>At the start there are 3 objects placed on your board.</p>

<p>To move an object:</p>
<steps>
  <item>
    <p>Click on the object you want to move.</p>
    <note><p>Ensure there is a clear path from the origin cell to the destination cell, otherwise the attempt to move the object will fail</p></note>
  </item>
  <item><p>Click on the cell you want to move the object to.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>Each time you move an object, additional objects are placed randomly on the board. The larger the <link xref="change-board-size">size of your board</link>, the more objects are placed on the board. A preview of the objects to be placed on the board appears in the upper left corner of the game window.</p>

<p>A straight horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of five or more similar objects will disappear from the game board.  When this happens you will have an extra move without additional objects being added to the board.</p>

<p>The more objects you clear, the longer the game will go on. The longer you play, the higher your <gui>Score</gui>.</p>

<p>The less objects you clear, the more crowded the board will become. The game is over when the board full.</p>

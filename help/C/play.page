  <title>How to Play</title>
<p> Playing <key>Five or More</key> is easy. At startup, you find
      yourself with five objects randomly positioned on <gui>the board</gui>. Each turn,
      you are allowed to move one object. You can move it anywhere on the board as long as 
 there is a clear path. Afterward, the computer drops more objects
      at random positions (the exact number depends on the size of the game). You can preview the next objects to be
      dropped in the upper left corner of the game's window.
      If you manage to align five objects of the same shape and color, they
      disappear and you are given an extra move before more objects drop.</p>



<p> Starting <key>Five or More </key> presents you with the
    game board and a new game starts. What it 
    looks like is shown below </p>

<p> As the game progresses, the board gets more and more crowded 
     (unless you are really good...) and making objects disappear gets harder
     and harder. The game is over, when the board is full.

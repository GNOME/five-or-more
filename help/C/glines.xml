  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para> 
   <application>Five or More</application>, is the Gnome port of the once
   popular Windows game called <application>Color Lines</application>
   The game's objective is to align as often as possible five or more objects
   of the same color and shape causing them to disappear. Play as long as possible, and
   be #1 in the High Scores.
   
  </para>

  <para>
   To run <application>Five or More</application>, select
   <guimenuitem>Five or More</guimenuitem> from the
   <guisubmenu>Games</guisubmenu> submenu of the <guimenu>Main
   Menu</guimenu>, or type <command>glines</command> on the
   command line. 
  </para>

  <para>
   <application>Five or More</application> is included in the
   <filename>GNOME-games</filename> package, which is part of the
   GNOME desktop environment. This document describes version
   &version; of <application>Five or More</application>.

 <!-- This section should describe basic usage of the application. -->

  <sect1 id="usage">
    <title>Playing Five or More</title>
    <para>
      Playing <application>Five or More</application> is easy. At startup, you find
      yourself with five objects randomly positioned on the board. Each turn,
      you are allowed to move one object. You can move it anywhere on the board as long as there is a clear path. Afterward, the computer drops more objects
      at random positions (the exact number depends on the size of the game). You can preview the next objects to be
      dropped in the upper right corner of the game's window.
      If you manage to align five objects of the same shape and color, they
      disappear and you are given an extra move before more objects
      drop.
    </para>

    Starting <application>Five or More</application> presents you with the
    <interface>game board</interface> and a new game starts. What it

   <para>
     As the game progresses, the board gets more and more crowded 
     (unless you are really good...) and making objects disappear gets harder
     and harder. The game is over, when the board is full.

      <title>Playing the Game</title>
      <para>
        A game of <application>Five or More</application> begins with some
        random objects on the board.
      </para>
      <para>
        To make a move, click on one of the objects. When an object is activated it
	starts rotating (or doing something else depending on the theme, but
	let us not anticipate&hellip;). You can then select its destination by
	clicking an empty square. If the path to the destination is clear
	the activated item travels there. If the destination square is occupied
	by another object nothing will be moved and the selection will be
	transferred to the new object. If the path is not clear (you cannot
	jump objects over obstacles!) the application prints a
	warning in the status bar (bottom of the window) and the original
	object remains active.
      </para>
      <para>
        As objects disappear, you get points. The points you score
	depends on the number of objects you managed to align (see
	<xref linkend="glines-table1" />). Your score is shown in the upper
	right corner of the window.

  <title>Using the Keyboard</title>
  <para>
  Instead of using the mouse you can use the keyboard to play <application>Five or More</application>. To use the keyboard, hit an arrow key and a cursor will appear near the center of the board. The arrow keys will move the cursor. When the cursor is over the object you want to move, use the spacebar to select it. Then shift the cursor to the object's destination and hit the space bar again to move the object.</para><para>If you start using the mouse again, the cursor will disappear. The cursor will reappear if you use the arrow keys again.

    <para>Each theme consists of a single PNG image file. This image
    consists of an array of seven rows, corresponding to the different
    object colors/shapes, and four columns, each of which is a frame in the
    animation of the object. The actual size of the image is irrelevant,
    it will be rescaled, but the sub-images must form a four by seven
    grid to get the correct effect. When using SVG remember that the
    image size is the page size, if your grid does not fill the page
    try shrinking the page size. Use an existing theme as a
    guide.</para>
